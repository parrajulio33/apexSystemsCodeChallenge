Here's the code exercise:

/* 

Your customer is a school. They want you to write a program that will accept a student's attendance record for a 6-day week and return whether or not a student's attendance is satisfactory. 

The record will be a string containing 6 uppercase characters, representing the student's attendance for each day in the week, Monday through Saturday. The record contains the following three characters only: 

'A' : Absent. 
'L' : Late. 
'P' : Present. 
Within the 6-day week, the attendance is not satisfactory if the student is absent twice or is late more than 2 days in a row. 

Examples: 

Input: "PPALLP" 
Output: True  // satisfactory

Input: "PPALLL"  //this two days in row
Output: False 



Input: "PAPALL" 
Output: False 



Input: "PLPALL" 
Output: True
